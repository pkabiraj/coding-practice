/**
 * <pre>Given a set of line segments, where each segment consists of a closed interval of the X-axis, a color, and a
 * height. When viewed from above, the color at point x on the X-axis is the color of the highest segment that includes x.
 * Write a program that takes lines segments as input, and outputs the view from above for these segments. You can
 * assume no two segments whose intervals overlap have the same height.</pre>

    /**
     * <pre>Key observation is that, viewed from above, the color can change at
     * most at an endpoint. This discretizes the problemâ€”we only need to consider the
     * endpoints, of which there are at most twice as many as line segments.
     * A brute-force algorithm then is to take these endpoints, and for each endpoint,
     * find the highest line segment containing it. To express the result as line segments, we
     * need to sort endpoints
     * Finding the highest line segment containing an endpoint has time complexity 0(n),
     * where n is the number of line segments, leading to an 0(n2) overall time bound.
     * We can improve the time complexity by recognizing that it is grossly inefficient
     * to test each endpoint against all line segments. Instead, we should track just the line
     * segments that contain the endpoint being processed, and to get the color efficiently
     * we should keep these line segments sorted by height
     * Specifically, we scan endpoints, maintaining the set of line segments that intersect
     * the current endpoint. This set is stored in a BST with the height being the key. The
     * color is determined by the highest line segment. When we encounter a left endpoint,
     * we add the corresponding line segment in a BST.When we encounter a right endpoint,
     * we remove the corresponding line segment from the BST.
     * As a concrete example, consider Figure 25.6 on the previous page. When we are
     * processing J's left endpoint, the BST consists of 77 and 7, with 77 appearing first (since
     * it is lower than 7). We add / to the BST, in between H and 7. The next endpoint
     * processed is 7's right endpoint, at which stage we remove 7 from the BST. Now / is
     * the highest line segment. From J's left endpoint to 7's right endpoint, the view from
     * above will be 7.</pre>
