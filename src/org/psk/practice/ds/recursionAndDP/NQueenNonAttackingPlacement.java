    /**
     * <pre>A brute-force approach is to consider all possible placements of the n
     * queensâ€”there are (n2 n) possible placements which grows very large with n.
     * Since we never would place two queens on the same row, a much faster solution
     * is to enumerate placements that use distinct rows. Such a placement cannot lead to
     * conflicts on rows, but it may lead to conflicts on columns and diagonals. It can be
     * represented by an array of length n, where the ith entry is the location of the queen
     * on Row i.
     * As an example, if n = 4, begin by placing the first row's queen at Column 0.
     * Now we enumerate all placements of the form (0, _, _, _). Placing the second row's
     * queen at Column 0 leads to a column conflict, so we skip all placements of the form
     * (0, 0, _, _). Placing the second row's queen at Column 1 leads to a diagonal conflict,
     * so we skip all placements of the form (0,1, _, _). Now we turn to placements of the
     * form (0, 2, 0, _). Such placements are conflicting because of the conflict on Column 0.
     * Now we turn to placements of the form (0, 2,1, _) and (0, 2, 2, _). Such placements
     * are conflicting because of the diagonal conflict between the queens at Row 1 and
     * Column 2 and Row 2 and Column 1, and the column conflict between the queens
     * at Row 1 and Column 2 and Row 2 and Column 2, respectively, so we move on to
     * (0, 2, 3, _), which also violates a diagonal constraint. Now we advance to placements
     * of the form (0,3, _, _). Both (0, 3, 1, _) and (0, 3, 2, _) lead to conflicts, implying there
     * is no non-attacking placement possible with a queen placed at Row 0 and Column 0.
     * The first non-attacking placement is (1, 3, 0, 2); the only other non-attacking placement
     * is (2, 0,3,1).</pre>
     * <pre>The time complexity is lower bounded by the number of non-attacking placements.
     * No exact form is known for this quantity as a function of n, but it is conjectured to
     * tend to n!/cn, where c * 2.54, which is super-exponential.</pre>
